/**
 * This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) component for the [Vanilla framework](https://docs.vanillaframework.io).
 *
 * The ThemeSwitcher component allows users to switch between different themes: dark, light, and system. It saves the selected theme in local storage and applies it to the document body. You can use it in user settings.
 *
 * In your root component, call the exported functions `loadTheme` and `applyTheme`, such as in the example below:
 * ```
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   const theme = loadTheme();
 *   applyTheme(theme);
 * }, []);
 * ```
